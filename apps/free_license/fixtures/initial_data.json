By\r\ncontrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\r\nfreedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it\r\nremains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\r\nFoundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our\r\nsoftware; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\r\nauthors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\r\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\r\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\r\nof others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly\r\nexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both\r\nusers' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be\r\nmarked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed\r\nerroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\r\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\r\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\r\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\r\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\r\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\r\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\r\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\r\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\r\nfreedom of users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and\r\nuse of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we\r\nwish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free\r\nprogram could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the\r\nGPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program\r\nnon-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"terms\"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section0\"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General\r\nPublic License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply\r\nto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed\r\nunder this License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.\r\n&ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be\r\nindividuals or organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or\r\npart of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other\r\nthan the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a\r\n&ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work\r\n&ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or\r\na work based on the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it\r\nthat, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily\r\nliable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except\r\nexecuting it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation\r\nincludes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making\r\navailable to the public, and in some countries other activities as\r\nwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that\r\nenables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with\r\na user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\r\nconveying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal\r\nNotices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and\r\nprominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright\r\nnotice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work\r\n(except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees\r\nmay convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\r\nLicense. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\r\nsuch as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section1\"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form\r\nof the work for making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo;\r\nmeans any non-source form of a work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either\r\nis an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in\r\nthe case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\r\nlanguage, one that is widely used among developers working in that\r\nlanguage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include\r\nanything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the\r\nnormal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of\r\nthat Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work\r\nwith that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for\r\nwhich an implementation is available to the public in source code\r\nform. A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major\r\nessential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific\r\noperating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a\r\ncompiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used\r\nto run it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code\r\nform means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for\r\nan executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,\r\nincluding scripts to control those activities. However, it does not\r\ninclude the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\r\ngenerally available free programs which are used unmodified in\r\nperforming those activities but which are not part of the work. For\r\nexample, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files\r\nassociated with source files for the work, and the source code for\r\nshared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is\r\nspecifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\r\ncommunication or control flow between those subprograms and other\r\nparts of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\r\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section2\"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright\r\nlaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section3\"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From\r\nAnti-Circumvention Law.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\r\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\r\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\r\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\r\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section4\"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section5\"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\r\nconditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received\r\n    it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright\r\nare not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's\r\nusers beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered\r\nwork in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section6\"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\r\n    Source from a network server at no charge.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these\r\n    requirements.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\r\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\r\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\r\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\r\nexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not\r\nbe included in conveying the object code work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer\r\nproduct&rdquo;, which means any tangible personal property which is\r\nnormally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)\r\nanything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In\r\ndetermining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\r\nshall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product\r\nreceived by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the\r\nstatus of the particular user or of the way in which the particular\r\nuser actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A\r\nproduct is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\r\nsubstantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such\r\nuses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any\r\nmethods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\r\nto install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that\r\nUser Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\r\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\r\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\r\nsolely because modification has been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\r\nor specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs\r\nas part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of\r\nthe User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for\r\na fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\r\ninclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,\r\nwarranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by\r\nthe recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified\r\nor installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\r\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\r\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\r\nnetwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\r\nprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\r\npublicly documented (and with an implementation available to the\r\npublic in source code form), and must require no special password or\r\nkey for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section7\"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the\r\nterms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its\r\nconditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire\r\nProgram shall be treated as though they were included in this License,\r\nto the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\r\npermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\r\nseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\r\ngoverned by this License without regard to the additional\r\npermissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material\r\nyou add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright\r\nholders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with\r\nterms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\r\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\r\n    or authors of the material; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\r\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\r\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\r\n    impose on those licensors and authors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered\r\n&ldquo;further restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.\r\nIf the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a\r\nnotice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term\r\nthat is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\r\ndocument contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\r\nconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\r\ngoverned by the terms of that license document, provided that the\r\nfurther restriction does not survive such relicensing or\r\nconveying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in\r\nthe form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\r\nabove requirements apply either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section8\"></a>8. Termination.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate\r\nthe licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you\r\nunder this License. If your rights have been terminated and not\r\npermanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for\r\nthe same material under section 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section9\"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having\r\nCopies.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\r\nso.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section10\"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\r\nRecipients.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring\r\ncontrol of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or\r\nsubdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation\r\nof a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to\r\nthat transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\r\nwhatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had\r\nor could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession\r\nof the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in\r\ninterest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\r\nefforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section11\"></a>11. Patents.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes\r\nuse under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program\r\nis based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's\r\n&ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all\r\npatent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\r\nacquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\r\nmanner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its\r\ncontributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed\r\nonly as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\r\nversion. For purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo;\r\nincludes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent\r\nwith the requirements of this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\nroyalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent\r\nclaims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\r\nmodify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo;\r\nis any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\r\nenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\r\nor covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\r\n&ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a party means to make\r\nsuch an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the\r\nparty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent\r\nlicense, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for\r\nanyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License,\r\nthrough a publicly available network server or other readily\r\naccessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding\r\nSource to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the\r\nbenefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)\r\narrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\r\nto extend the patent license to downstream recipients.\r\n&ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that,\r\nbut for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a\r\ncountry, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,\r\nwould infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\r\nyou have reason to believe are valid.</p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not\r\ninclude within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,\r\nor is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights\r\nthat are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a\r\ncovered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party\r\nthat is in the business of distributing software, under which you make\r\npayment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\r\nconveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of\r\nthe parties who would receive the covered work from you, a\r\ndiscriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the\r\ncovered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or\r\n(b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or\r\ncompilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\r\nthat arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28\r\nMarch 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section12\"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\r\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do\r\nnot excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\r\nconvey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\r\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\r\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\r\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\r\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\r\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\r\nfrom conveying the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section13\"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public\r\nLicense.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section14\"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you\r\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nnumbered version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number\r\nof the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section15\"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\r\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY\r\nAND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\r\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\r\nCORRECTION.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section16\"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES\r\nAND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\r\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\r\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\r\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\r\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGES.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section17\"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and\r\n16.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"howto\"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New\r\nPrograms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\r\nterms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full\r\nnotice is found.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it\r\ndoes.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at\r\nyour option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\r\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
